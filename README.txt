This is my Python final project for my Data Science 4420 Machine Learning/Data Mining 2 class taken in Spring 2021.

This project is a proof of concept of using computer vision to do quality assurance validation in a procedurally generated visual medium. Specifically in this Project the procedurally generated visual medium is Minecraft. 

For this project I personally captured 8000 images both interesting and benign of the procedurally generated content in minecraft and evaluated and gave each image 9 different varying labels that would be used in varying machine learning approaches.

The whole code base is prepared to run as is on this google collab -
